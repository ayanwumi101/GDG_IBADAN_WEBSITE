## Edustipend Frontend Engineer Pre-work Assignment

I created a new react application using Vite, and i installed Chakra UI library for easy styling. I also installed Ckahra UI icons library just to test out the UI.

## Core Components that make up the user-interface in the mockup design.

- Button component
- Navbar component
- Accordion component
- Heading component

## Explanation of the component built.

- I built the button component use Box and Button components from Chakra UI. The component can be used anywhere in the app, the only thing needed is just to pass some props to the component, some of them are: 
   - bg
   - color
   - fontSize
   - width
   - height and
   - text

- The next component i built is the Accordion component, the component also takes some props, some of them are listed below.
   - icon
   - text
   - bg
   - color
   - fontWeight
   - fontSize and 
   - width

- The next component i built is the Navbar component, the component takes in a single prop, which is the links prop.

The UI is fully responsive on all devices.
